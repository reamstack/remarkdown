The circus is in town, spun up on a bright bed of golden straw behind the bars and restaurants of the harbor. Driving past on the 1 one can see the big tent and imagine its elephants inside. They are happy elephants notwithstanding what Betsy said, that poor thing. There are peanuts and popcorn and cotton candy, all hot on account of the Sun and the machines used to prepare them. Towheaded children romp in the straw. At least three of them are his.

---

An olympic pool with high diving platforms, financed and constructed by a long-dormant regime. Banners hanging from the ceiling. Clear blue water with shining white lights all around.

---

A shady tree funnel directs fat, sunburnt bodies onto the tattered weed-stifling mats that blanket Cazenovia Lake's southernmost wading area. A dog sits patiently, a good boy, waiting to splash wildly after his new favorite stick when it takes flight.

A trio of twenty-something bugmen bray soyishly, though one is lean and well-muscled. 

Farmgirls and their parents float out past the mats, wrapping up their outing. 

It's warmer now in than out, plus the mosquitoes can't dive. 

The moonlight will paint a very different picture...

---

A warm gathering in a second-floor apartment on the Coastside, where an odd toy is provided and seems out of place. The light is orange, deeper than the sodium street lamps and mellower. The father is there and has taken the rest there with him and it is a special night. The reason for the gathering is not so clear and could be a little bit weird. It is for seekers, most of whom would be better off if they stopped seeking.

---

A friend named Merrick. Again, with the weird toys. No one else's memories corroborate. Fluffy white carpets and safety windows, the windows very much before their time.

---

A boy of 4 cast out into the deep dark woods, leaving a trail of slick white pebbles from his home. The pebbles shimmer in the moonlight. This much is lifted straight from the Grimms. Twist: *he forgets that he has left the pebbles but then he finds them anyway*. Back out of the woods in his Jesus Year to vanquish the terrible beast that sent him off in the first place. Finds it much diminished from prior howling-library-thing-in-Ghostbusters form; it is the size of a field mouse and *not to be harmed*.

---

A steep valley with heavily laden eucalyptus trees feeds and shades a lake blanketed with AM mist. Cypress trees at the bottom are hangers for moss, the moss a substrate for crisp dewdrops. A young woman with dark hair and gray eyes bathes in a shallow stream near the shore, smiling. A barge floats on the lake and she has swum from it. Farther up the walls of the valley, the eucalyptus grow spindly and weird, their fanned-out tops intercepting all but the dullest rays. A solitary workshop sits on rocks by the shore, soaking all day in dawn and dusk light, not far from where the woman is bathing. Its owner made the barge and lives and works by the water. 

---

The yard in the kindergarten playground. The bars on the trikes and the corrugated steel container that held all the equipment. The red pneumatic balls that must have been made just after the war. The sea right there and its mist.

---

The almost-Japanese garden in the back at the HMB library. The recurring dream where a towering wall must be climbed and the root of an enormous tree makes that possible.

---
The roses in the back by the swing and the sunset and the feeling about Erin that goes with it. The view upward into the trees.

---

The view downhill at the end of the block by the stream, but not very close and the feeling about Rosa that accompanies that view.

---

The otherwordly scene at the Guntersville State Park Lodge and the feeling that Mary was coming around to my view of things.

---

The Fourth of July parade in Half Moon Bay and the feeling that I am part of something really great.
